                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">--- Updated 11/28<br>Hello. First and foremost we want to take this opportunity to thank you for your time and energy to review our project. This is our first impression and we plan on making it as impactful as possible. We realize we only have this one chance to present our business to you and we plan on maximizing that today. Before we begin with the opportunity you have given us to define our business strategy, plan of action and overall philosophy, vision etc. We would like to tell you, our potential investor, what brought us here to this point. We want to take this important opportunity to present the concept and philosophy behind this project. As a team we have all been in the very situation you find yourself in now reading this white paper. Searching for a valid, successful, lucrative and sound investment. You are asking yourself what is RuntzCoin? What is the purpose of this coin? What utilities does it have planned? What is the team's vision?<br><br>So here is our approach to this situation. We want to keep our business model and focus simple. No extreme complexity or over complicated formulas. No tiers or levels of holders that benefit based purely on how much they can afford to hold. To us every coin holder is an important investor trusting us to deliver on one thing...Profitability. We have decided to keep our plan focused on that most important measurement. Plain and simple....how much money or profit you experience when investing in our project using a community based approach and business model. Here at RuntzCoin, we strive to create equality, operate as an inclusive, diverse and equal force moving through this crypto experience. Together. As one unit.<br><br><strong>Introduction What is RuntzCoin?</strong><br><br>RuntzCoin is the one and only Cannabis, 100% community based, owned and driven DeFi utility project being launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The intentional focus of this project is to serve an identified need within the Cannabis customer base and community as well as the larger market of crypto in general. The name RuntzCoin itself is based on a personal preference to the strain Runtz and serves as the mascot for our community effort and result.<br><br>To be clear, the purpose of RuntzCoin is not to promote or encourage exaggerated, extravagant sales pitch practices or selling you the illusion of some false claim or pretense. RuntzCoin is here as a project displayed before you to consider, review and ultimately invest in as a legitimate token with a researched, deliberate and necessary need within the Cannabis community.<br><br>We are not a meme token simply launched for the sake of launching, becoming satisfied to dwell in the shadows of countless meme tokens or the hype project of the day. RuntzCoin was developed and created to become a tangible, sustainable reality that is built to evolve and conform as the Crypto and Metaverse continue to progress to limits unknown as it materializes before our eyes. The basic fundamentals of business are irrefutable. A business model must be open, flexible, willing to adjust strategies and the overall mindset to function, grow and evolve. All levels and foundations of business begin with an initial plan of action yet if you refuse to listen to your customer base, ignore the feedback or sentiment of your investors and customer base or demographic, you are destined to become stagnant. RuntzCoin understands this dynamic. We are fully prepared to acknowledge the fact that we can not operate a business<br><br><br><br> successfully or produce a lucrative product or project if there lacks any semblance of true transparency and the willingness to listen and react. We place the greatest importance on being prepared to address concerns and create an immediate correction of errors as they materialize. In short and to the point, there is a fine line to providing service and disservice to our most valued asset in business...it is the ability to listen and react to you, the customer, the investor and our commitment to both.<br><br>This vision of this project has become possible because of the diligent efforts of a talented, resourceful and cooperative community. Everything you see in this project is a community effort. We plan to remain diligent and grass roots based in all of our business practices.<br><br><strong>What is the purpose of RuntzCoin?<br></strong><br>RuntzCoin has conducted months of detailed study, analysis, data derived from previous Binance Smart Chain (BSC) project launches and performance. Today we are here to present to you the result of utilizing that data, informed insight and feedback. RuntzCoin. Driven by a deep rooted respect and love for the use and science responsible for Cannabis products, such as Rick Simpson Oil (RSO), as well as the countless other medicinal and recreational uses of Cannabis, we wanted to create RuntzCoin as a dedication to this passion and interest.<br><br>RuntzCoin is the product we present to you after months of community dialogue and engagement. The common denominator we have identified is one basic thing....maximize investor returns while providing community engagement and token utility. RuntzCoin seeks to bring innovation, a deep passion for Cannabis and a valuable necessity to our respective community. This is our purpose and commitment. RuntzCoin isn't focused on a get rich today scheme or empty promise. RuntzCoin is focused on the longevity and sustainability of the project.<br><br>Our plan is simple. Our purpose will be impactful.<br><br>RuntzCoin will establish a voice in the community and support the reinforcement of the positive properties and practices of Cannabis. We stand for the cause and purpose of Cannabis in every state and country. RuntzCoin represents and encourages a professional, supportive attitude in relation to Cannabis.<br><br>RuntzCoin will support real charity work and support along with global humanitarian efforts as not only a business model and value but also as a way of doing business in all aspects of our project.<br><br><strong>RuntzCoin and the Metaverse<br></strong><br>RuntzCoin is dedicated to acquiring digital real estate and what we believe to be the best venue, club and lounge, Runtz Lounge, in the Metaverse. We plan to integrate our love, respect and passion for Cannabis and bring it to the virtual world. Realize this one thing, the way people interact on the internet is continuously changing as well as the need for more outlets and capabilities to do so. We are standing at the forefront of a new evolution to everything we know and believe. Timelines and additional details to come, overview will be covered in the Roadmap. The overall development of this is still in progress and in our plan of action.<br><br><br><br><strong> RuntzCoin as a Dispensary Coin<br></strong><br>RuntzCoin is currently working on becoming the stable coin used in dispensaries all over the world. Anyone who has experienced going to the dispensary understands the struggle. You are being limited to cash, using an ATM, whether cash or cashless, while the ongoing struggle of card networks distancing themselves from dispensaries as a general practice continues. Technicalities still exist between legalized states and areas and still not having access to merchant codes or other difficulties that arise from attempting a transaction using any type of credit or debit card. This is where RuntzCoin enters. We plan to leverage our coin as a bridge between the two opportunities. The dispensary's limitation of what tender it can accept and the consumer having to resort to cash transactions or using an ATM in a digital age and economy. Here we are entering into a new age of digital currency and knocking on the front door of the Metaverse, a literal virtual world taking life and shape before us and we have people having to resort to an ATM in a dispensary.??? Further details to come, the timeline and dates will be included on the Roadmap.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
