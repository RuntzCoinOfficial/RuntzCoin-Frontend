                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the next best time is now” ~Chinese proverb.<br><br>RuntzCoin is the next breakout, innovative, evolutionary project. We are THE Cannabis inspired, community driven, deflationary utility token. The utility of our token, RuntzLand, our trademark, brand specific, solution to social connection creates limitless possibility and tangible purpose to this project. RuntzLand, our own virtual reality space in the Metaverse, will be fueled by RuntzCoin and provides users the opportunity to interact with a computer generated environment as well as other users. There will also be the option to buy land to build personal venues in addition to experiencing person to person interaction. To insure this happens within our business plan we are also in the process of accomplishing the following:<br>● First and most important, RuntzCoin is currently in the process of obtaining the Solidproof KYC and Certik Audit.<br>● Second, RuntzSwap. RuntzCoin already has integrated its own open-source DeFi based exchange built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) through which the platform users can swap BEP-20 tokens.<br>● Third, RuntzCoin is in the process of obtaining multiple listings to expand our market, exposure and presence in the crypto world.<br>● Fourth, RuntzCoin is already in negotiations with our initial canvassing of select Cannabis dispensaries. RuntzCoin is actively exploring the endless possibilities such as brand specific merchandise, acceptance of RuntzCoin as a form of currency and building necessary business relations to further encompass our purpose and utility.<br>● RuntzCoin is in the process of developing our own brand specific NFT Marketplace to capitalize on this still growing market.<br>● The RuntzCoin development team is currently in evaluation and research to ensure this token's success as well as expand on its current utility of this project and launch additional features in the near future.<br>A project is only as strong and successful as the community it has created.<br>RuntzCoin will remain active, supportive and visible in our effort to create, build and foster our 100% community based project and business model. The overall goal is to keep our plan of action within reach and obtainable while also maintaining our focus to keep transparent interaction with all of our investors. Our commitment is to create no extreme complexity or over complicated formulas involved in our project, no tiers or levels of holders that benefit based purely on how much they can afford to hold. To us every coin holder is an important investor trusting us to deliver on one thing...Profitability. We have decided to keep our plan focused on that most important measurement. Plain and simple....How much money or profit you experience when investing in our project. Here at RuntzCoin, we strive to create equality, operate as an inclusive, diverse and equal force moving through this crypto experience. Together. As one unit.<br>The Introduction<br>“The entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to it and exploits it as an opportunity” Peter Drucker<br>RuntzCoin is the product of a vision created and realized in the true spirit of innovative entrepreneurship. This project will succeed. Investors will realize profits based on our trends and analysis. A bold statement to make, but realize this coin in its existence without a formal launch has already experienced a steady climb and is profiting its current holders. Since its initial posting and trial run, RuntzCoin has already accomplished an immediate cut of 6 zeros. Our growth has been purely organic with no assistance or expensive marketing or measures.<br> What is RuntzCoin?<br>“Every project is an opportunity to learn, to figure out problems and challenges, to invent and reinvent.”<br>David Rockwell<br>RuntzCoin is the one and only Cannabis, 100% community based, owned and driven DeFi utility project being launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The intentional focus of this project is to serve an identified need within the Cannabis customer base and community as well as the larger market of crypto in general. The name RuntzCoin itself is based on a personal preference to the strain Runtz and serves as the mascot for our community effort and result.<br>New crypto projects are created everyday, resulting in hundreds of promising releases yet very few succeed.<br>To be clear, the purpose of RuntzCoin is not to promote or encourage exaggerated, extravagant sales pitch practices or selling you the illusion of some false claim or pretense. RuntzCoin is here as a project displayed before you to consider, review and ultimately invest in as a legitimate token with a researched, deliberate and necessary need within the Cannabis community.<br>We are not a meme token simply launched for the sake of launching, becoming satisfied to dwell in the shadows of countless meme tokens or the hype project of the day. RuntzCoin was developed and created to become a tangible, sustainable reality that is built to evolve and conform as the Crypto and Metaverse continue to progress to limits unknown as it materializes before our eyes. The basic fundamentals of business are irrefutable. A business model must be open, flexible, willing to adjust strategies and the overall mindset to function, grow and evolve. All levels and foundations of business begin with an initial plan of action yet if you refuse to listen to your customer base, ignore the feedback or sentiment of your investors and customer base or demographic, you are destined to become stagnant. RuntzCoin understands this dynamic. In short and to the point, there is a fine line to providing service and disservice to our most valued asset in business...it is the ability to listen and react to you, the customer, the investor and our commitment to both.<br>This vision of this project has become possible because of the diligent efforts of a talented, resourceful and cooperative community. Everything you see in this project is a community effort. We plan to remain diligent and grass roots based in all of our business practices.<br>What is the purpose of RuntzCoin?<br>“If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door” Milton Berle<br>scheme or empty promise. RuntzCoin is focused on the longevity and sustainability of the project. RuntzCoin has conducted months of detailed study, analysis, data derived from previous Binance Smart<br>Chain (BSC) project launches and performance. Today we are here to present to you the result of utilizing that data, informed insight and feedback. RuntzCoin. Driven by a deep rooted respect and love for the use and science responsible for Cannabis products, such as Rick Simpson Oil (RSO), as well as the countless other medicinal and recreational uses of Cannabis, we wanted to create RuntzCoin as a dedication to this passion and interest.<br>RuntzCoin is the product we present to you after months of community dialogue and engagement. The common denominator we have identified is one basic thing....maximize investor returns while providing community engagement and token utility. RuntzCoin seeks to bring innovation, a deep passion for Cannabis and a valuable necessity to our respective community. This is our purpose and commitment. RuntzCoin isn't focused on a get rich today<br>Our plan is simple. Our purpose will be impactful.<br><br> RuntzCoin will establish a voice in the community and support the reinforcement of the positive properties and practices of Cannabis. We stand for the cause and purpose of Cannabis in every state and country. RuntzCoin represents and encourages a professional, supportive attitude in relation to Cannabis.<br>RuntzCoin will support real charity work and support along with global humanitarian efforts as not only a business model and value but also as a way of doing business in all aspects of our project.<br>RuntzSwap<br>“The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed.” William Gibson<br>What is RuntzSwap? In an effort to further offer you utility, ease of use and a universal platform to trade, purchase and swap coins....We present to you RuntzSwap. Most of you who regularly buy, sell, trade coins understand the complexity involved. The inconvenience of having to function between trading platforms just to purchase your favorite coins. In response to the feedback from our community we have decided to offer our own branded solution. So here it is...you can come right here on RuntzCoin and use RuntzSwap as your universal trading platform.<br>RuntzCoin and RuntzLand<br>“The future is not something to predict. The future is something to build” Franco Ongaro<br>RuntzCoin is dedicated to building a virtual, digital experience for users to interact, as well as participate in the exciting experience and opportunity to buy real estate and build their ultimate virtual dream world reality. While this is a project currently under construction and in the works, we wanted to share this development as soon as possible. We plan to integrate our love, respect and passion for Cannabis and bring it to the virtual world. Realize this one thing, the way people interact on the internet is continuously changing as well as the need for more outlets and capabilities to do so. We are standing at the forefront of a new evolution to everything we know and believe. Timelines and additional details to come. The overall development of this is still in progress and in our plan of action.<br>RuntzCoin as a Dispensary Coin<br>“I say luck is when an opportunity comes along and you're prepared for it” Denzel Washington<br>RuntzCoin is currently researching what it will take to become the coin of choice to be used in dispensaries all over the country as local, state and federal guidelines and policy permit. To navigate this RuntzCoin plans to work in accordance with<br>Anyone who has experienced going to the dispensary understands the struggle. You are being limited to cash, using an ATM, whether cash or cashless, while the ongoing struggle of card networks distancing themselves from dispensaries as a general practice continues. Technicalities still exist between legalized states and areas and still not having access to merchant codes or other difficulties that arise from attempting a transaction using any type of credit or debit card. This is where RuntzCoin enters. We plan to leverage our coin as a bridge between the two opportunities. The dispensary's limitation of what tender it can accept and the consumer having to resort to cash transactions or using an ATM in a digital age and economy. Here we are entering into a new age of digital currency and knocking on the front door of the Metaverse, a literal virtual world taking life and shape before us and we have people having to resort to an ATM in a dispensary.??? Further details and updates to come as this endeavor continues to develop.<br><br>RuntzCoin NFT Marketplace<br>“Our imagination is the only limit to what we can hope to have in the future” Charles Kettering<br>What is an NFT? The common definition is : “NFTs (or “non-fungible tokens”) are a crypto asset in which each token is unique, as opposed to “fungible” assets like Bitcoin and dollar bills, which are all worth exactly the same amount. Because every NFT is unique, they can be used to authenticate ownership of digital assets like artworks, recordings, and virtual real estate or pets.” At the time of creating this business plan and introduction, our talented, diligent developers are working to create a brand specific NFT Marketplace to again further the value and utility of the RuntzCoin project. Here we are working towards not just creating another “coin or token”...we are working to build the foundation of an actual purposeful utility and project. The endgame or vision of RuntzCoin NFT Marketplace is to have a unique platform to buy brand specific NFTs, compete in contests with a chance to add to our NFT line up and also benefit with exposure, adding to the brand and of course reward.<br>RuntzCoin Tokenomics &amp; Allocation<br>“Nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity” H.
